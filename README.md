# Setup Notes

This is most of the foundation needed to build out my current env. Please see below for the details around it.

## Overall Setup
- tmux
- vim
- zsh
- iTerm
- oh-my-zsh

## Addons for making the above work
- Fix for tmux and pbcopy
  - `brew install reattach-to-user-namespace`
- Vundle
  - `git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle`
- oh-my-zsh
- Solarized color themes for both tmux and iTerm

## Getting Started
I have started on an `init.sh` as a starting place for getting files in place etc

You will need oh-my-zsh in place before running the init
